### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jack
#### Iâ€™m currently a junior at Cornell University studying Computer Science and Operations Research, interested in pursuing a career in machine learning and data analysis or software development.  
I am a highly motivated junior at Cornell University passionate about pursuing a career in computer science and operations research. I aim to contribute to meaningful projects and make a positive impact utilizing my skills in machine learning, optimization, and software development. I am driven by growing from my experiences, being at the forefront of technologies, and developing real world solutions, and I really value seeing the direct impact of my work. I am committed to continuous learning, and I am looking for opportunities and organizations that share and will help me grow my values.

Programming Skills: OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING / DATA STRUCTURES / ALGORITHMS / TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS / TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT / AGILE / VERSION CONTROL / SCRUM  
Programming Languages: JAVA / PYTHON / SQL / OCAML / C++  
Development Tools: GIT / VSCODE / INTELLIJ / ECLIPSE / JIRA / AZURE / ATOM / TABLEAU  
Other Technical Skills: MACHINE LEARNING / DATA SCIENCE / STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY / VERSION CONTROL  
Python Packages: NUMPY / PANDAS / MATPLOTLIB / SKLEARN / PYTORCH  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at Staples, Inc., leveraging my skills in Java and SQL to design and implement robust data pipelines that efficiently collect, transform, and validate the data for a database totaling over 500 million records. I am also working closely with a PhD student at Cornell who wrote a paper describing a 2-approximation algorithm to the k-MST problem to implement the algorithm in Python.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my passion for using machine learning and the intersection between software development and data science to develop complex models and algorithms to solve meaningful problems!
