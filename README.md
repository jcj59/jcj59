### Jack Jansons
#### Incoming SWE @ Meta | Computer Science and Operations Research Cornell '25
I am a highly motivated junior at Cornell University studying computer science and operations research and am passionate about pursing a career in Quantitative Trading, Software Engineering, or Data Science. I am fascinated by data and using my knowledge of numbers and probabilities to predict events and understand the world around me. 

In my career, I aim to contribute to meaningful projects and make a positive impact utilizing my skills in machine learning, optimization, data science, and software development. I am driven by growing from my experiences, being at the forefront of technologies, and developing real world solutions. I really value seeing the direct impact of my work, and I love to be challenged. I am committed to continuous learning, and I am looking for opportunities and organizations that share and will help me grow my values.

In my free time, I am an avid runner and compete in club track and field and cross country meets through Cornell Running Club and the National Intercollegiate Running Club Association (NIRCA). I love both watching and playing sports, and many of my projects are centered around them. I also have a love of games and play Settlers of Catan semi competitively and am trying to get better at Poker.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on developing a sports betting handicapping system for the NFL which predicts spreads for every game incorporating team power rankings, key player injuries, and environmental factors. I use data science and analysis to create power rankings and player impact values as well as identifying how different environmental factors have impacted different teams historically. I am also working on an AI based Marathon Training Coach application which takes your personal running data and your goals and suggests workouts and long runs for the coming week. This system relies on interpretable machine learning algorithms in order to maintain trust from the user.

- âš¡ Fun facts: I recently participated in the 2023 Ragnar Reach the Beach relay race with a Cornell Running Club team, and we collectively ran 200 miles in less than 24 hours (1st place finish overall for the mixed gender division!) and I am preparing for the coming track season as well as the 2024 Seneca7 relay race where a team of 7 will collectively run 77 miles around Seneca Lake. Last year we won the whole event, so the pressure is on to defend our title!
