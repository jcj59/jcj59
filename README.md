### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jack
#### I am a student at Cornell University studying Computer Science with a potential double major in Operations Research.
I am a highly motivated college sophomore with excellent leadership, communication, and presentation skills.  I am a passionate and fast learner interested in pursuing a career in machine learning and data analysis or software development.  I am really interested in solving meaningful problems using machine learning, optimization methods, and software development.

Programming Skills: OOP / DATA STRUCTURES / ALGORITHMS / TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS / TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT  
Programming Languages: JAVA / PYTHON / OCAML / JAVASCRIPT / HTML / C++  
Development Tools: GIT / VSCODE / ATOM / ECLIPSE  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementing HashLife which utilizes a quadtree and memoization to efficiently simulate John Conway's Game of Life in OCaml.  My end goal is to develop a turing machine within the game.  I am also working on developing AI to solve my Flappy Bird clone using neuroevolution as well as developing and maintaining an interactive website for The Wardrobe at Cornell.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning and how to analyze algorithms in class.  Independently, I am learning about quadtrees and neuroevolution while strengthening my JavaScript and HTML skills.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my passion for using machine learning and the intersection between software development and data science to develop complex models and algorithms to solve meaningful problems!
