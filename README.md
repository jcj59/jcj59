### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jack
#### Iâ€™m currently a sophomore at Cornell University studying Computer Science with a potential double major in Operations Research, interested in pursuing a career in machine learning and data analysis or software development.  
Iâ€™m very passionate and highly motivated, with excellent leadership, communication, and presentation skills. Iâ€™m a fast learner, and I seek to solve meaningful problems using machine learning, optimization methods, and software development.

Programming Skills: OOP / DATA STRUCTURES / ALGORITHMS / TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS / TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT  
Programming Languages: JAVA / PYTHON / OCAML / JAVASCRIPT / HTML / SQL / TABLEAU / C++  
Development Tools: GIT / VSCODE / ATOM / INTELLIJ  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementing HashLife which utilizes a quadtree and memoization to efficiently simulate John Conway&#39;s Game of Life in OCaml. My end goal is to develop a turing machine within the game. Iâ€™m also working on developing AI to solve my Flappy Bird clone using neuroevolution, as well as developing and maintaining an interactive website for The Wardrobe at Cornell (an organization that provides free professional clothing for students through rental services and pop-up events so any student can pursue any opportunity).  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my passion for using machine learning and the intersection between software development and data science to develop complex models and algorithms to solve meaningful problems!  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jcj59@cornell.edu
- âš¡ Fun facts: I spend my free time running for Cornell Running Club, for which Iâ€™m currently the Vice President. I recently participated in the 2022 Ragnar Reach the Beach relay race with a Cornell Running Club team, and we collectively ran 200 miles in less than 24 hours (3rd place finish overall out of over 300 teams)!
